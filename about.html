        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <p>
          I'm all about collaboration and making things happen. Finding ways to
          streamline processes and make them more effective is what I love.
          Currently, I'm immersing myself in web design at the National College
          of Ireland, aiming to enhance my skills and explore new career avenues
          while still thriving as an Operations Lead in a tech company.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over six years of experience as a team lead, I've honed my skills
          in guiding and motivating teams to success. When I'm not focused on my
          professional endeavors, you'll find me coaching and empowering my
          teammates to reach their full potential. Sharing knowledge and
          fostering growth are at the core of my values. Let's create something
          incredible together!
        </p>
        <p>
          On the tech side, I'm familiar with tools like Jira, Google Workspace,
          Slack, and Apple devices and applications. I also have a basic grasp
          of Java and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive under pressure and can meet tight deadlines without
          compromising quality. My blend of skills, experience, and strong work
          ethic makes me an asset to any team or organization. Continuously
          striving for improvement and excellence is what drives me forward in
          any role I take on.
