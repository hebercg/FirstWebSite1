        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a team player who can effectively drive projects to success. With
          a proven track record of identifying and removing inefficiencies in
          processes, I possess an executional approach mindset that is focused
          on achieving success. In addition to my skills and experience, I also
          have a passion for coaching team members to reach their full
          potential. Whether through formal training or on-the-job coaching, I
          invest in team members' individual development goals to help them
          thrive in their roles. I believe that sharing knowledge and guiding
          others is crucial to the success of any team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience working with Jira, Google Workspace, Slack, and
          Apple devices and applications. Additionally, I have a basic
          understanding of Java and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive under pressure, and I can work to tight deadlines without
          compromising the quality of my work. My skills, experience, and work
          ethic make me a valuable asset to any team or organization. I am
          always seeking to improve processes and drive success, and I believe
          that my passion for excellence will help me excel in any role I
          undertake.
